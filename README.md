# library

Example library for a deep dive into Event Sourcing

Book Entity is no entity
BookCreatedEvent is an entity.

Additional events can be attached, e.g. BookReservedEvent, BookStolenEvent etc. etc. 
These would complete the live cycle of a book in a library. The idea would be to have 
a historic view on the life cycle of books.
